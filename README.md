# GodotBackmostWindow

A basic example of how to make a backmost window using Win32 and Godot. 

A majority of this code is not original, it is a combination of various sources but mostly ties back to a licensed tutorial,

This is still WIP, the backmost part works but when the game is closed I'm not sure where to call my "clearDesktop" function. I am unfamiliar with Godot 
and just doing this for fun. 

Please read the code comments as there is a list of the research links there. I did not do a majority of the coding for this, just researching and compiling.
